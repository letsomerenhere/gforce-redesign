        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          SeaCube, one of the largest purchasers and lessors of refrigerated containers in the world, had been an Infor customer for 18 years. After years of relying on Infor Lawson, the leadership team was ready to modernize. This was not only about upgrading software, but also about rethinking business processes, eliminating outdated tools, and ensuring greater integration across systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a company committed to investing in innovative solutions that safeguard cargo, improve service reliability, and help customers reduce their carbon footprint while increasing profitability, SeaCube viewed this upgrade as a strategic opportunity to align its technology with its vision for the future.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Results at a Glance</h2>
  
        <ul class="cs-list">
          <li>A modern, cloud-based system accessible from anywhere</li>
          <li>Streamlined processes and improved business workflows</li>
          <li>Reduction of third-party software needs, lowering cost and complexity</li>
          <li>Greater integration across systems through a connected data lake</li>
          <li>Faster and more reliable reporting, reducing time to close the books</li>
          <li>Strong user adoption from day one, driven by early involvement and training</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          SeaCube’s finance team had deep expertise in Lawson v10 but was tied to decades-old processes. Reporting relied heavily on an Access database, creating inefficiencies and data bottlenecks. The controller recognized that a simple “lift and shift” would not deliver the business improvements needed. The true challenge was to modernize technology and simultaneously update business processes, integrate with other systems, and improve reporting to give leadership reliable, accessible insights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without investing in a full upgrade, SeaCube risked continuing inefficiencies, higher costs from third-party software dependencies, and limited scalability to support future growth.
        </p>
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>
          SeaCube partnered with GForce because of our ability to combine technical expertise with business process knowledge and because of our reputation for building confidence through collaboration. From the start, our approach centered on modernizing systems, engaging users early, and managing change in a way that built lasting adoption.
        </p>
        <h3>Key elements of the solution included:</h3>
        <ul class="cs-list">
          <li>Upgraded from Lawson v10 to Infor CloudSuite FSM</li>
          <li>Integrated a data lake for improved reporting and analytics</li>
          <li>Updated and streamlined outdated business processes</li>
          <li>Reduced reliance on third-party software and external reporting tools</li>
          <li>Delivered progressive training to ensure users were confident from day one</li>
          <li>Applied a modified waterfall methodology, blending structure with flexibility to incorporate late design changes without slowing progress</li>
          <li>Maintained a hybrid consulting model, with the GForce team onsite during key milestones such as CRP, SIT, and go-live, while leveraging remote collaboration to reduce costs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Change management was a central focus. Through executive sponsorship, proofs of concept, pilots, and continuous testing, GForce ensured users felt included at every step. By involving the finance team directly in design and unit testing, the solution reflected SeaCube’s needs and built strong ownership among end users.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the start, SeaCube’s leadership recognized that modernization required more than new technology. GForce’s ability to guide both process improvement and user adoption made the difference. Confidence in the solution grew as users were engaged early and often, which translated into strong adoption at go-live. The modernization not only delivered efficiency but also opened new opportunities for reporting and system integration.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Customer Perspective</h2>
          <p>
            “The GForce team gave us confidence at every step of the project. By involving our people early and supporting them throughout, they made change feel manageable. From day one of go-live, our team was ready and engaged, and we could see the benefits immediately.”
